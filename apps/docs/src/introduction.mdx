# Introduction

Texpress is an open-source project that provides a project setup for using **ExpressJS** with **Typescript**. It is designed to simplify the development process and make it easier to create web applications using these two technologies. With its built-in apps and packages, Texpress is modular and flexible, making it easy to get started with **ExpressJS** and **Typescript**, allowing developers to easily customize and extend the project as needed.

## Features

-   ### **Turborepo Integrated Monorepo Architecture:**
    Texpress uses a monorepo architecture to manage the codebase, making it easier to share code between different apps and packages. Texpress uses TurboRepo, a tool for managing monorepos, to streamline the development process and improve code organization.
-   ### **Built-in Apps:**
    Texpress includes several built-in apps
    -   **CMS App**  
        The `CMS` app included with Texpress provides an admin panel for managing content and data for your web application.
    -   **API App**  
        The `API` app included with Texpress provides a RESTful API to be consumed by the frontend of your web application.
    -   **Queue Consumer**  
        The `queue consumer` included with Texpress allows you to easily process messages from RabbitMQ queues, providing a scalable way to handle asynchronous tasks.
-   ### **Built-in Packages:**
    -   **Core**  
        The `core` package included with Texpress provides the foundational components of the framework, such as middleware, routing, and request/response handling.
    -   **Shared**  
        The `shared` package included with Texpress provides a common library of entities, utilities, and other shared code that can be used across different Texpress apps and packages.
    -   **RabbitMQ**  
        The `rabbitmq` package included with Texpress provides a RabbitMQ client for using queues, with built-in producers, consumers, and RabbitMQ clients. It makes it easy to integrate messaging into your web application, providing a scalable way to handle asynchronous tasks.

Designed to simplify developing complex applications with a solid foundation.
Ideal for developers who are familiar with these technologies, as well as those who are looking to learn and explore new technologies.
