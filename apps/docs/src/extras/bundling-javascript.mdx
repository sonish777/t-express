# Bundling Javascript Files for CMS

Texpress comes with `esbuild` setup configured for bundling CSS and Javascript files. The setup that comes with texpress is configured to watch the `resources` directory. From the resources directory, the single entry point to all Javascript files `resources/js/index.js` is minified, bundled and output to the `public/assets` directory. The same goes for CSS files with the directory `resources/css/index.css`.

To change the directories and other configurations, make changes to the `esbuild.config.js` file.

## To Build Javascript Files

```bash

yarn build:js

```

## To Build With Watch Mode for Development

```bash

yarn watch:js

```
