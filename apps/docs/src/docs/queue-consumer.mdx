# Queue - Consumer

The `Consumer` is responsible for consuming the messages passed to different queues. Texpress comes with a separate application for consuming queues. To create a consumer, create your consumer class by extending the `Consumer` class imported from the `rabbitmq` package. Then register your message handler by decorating the methods using the `@Consume` decorator. The `@Consume` decorator takes two arguments, the name of the exchange and the name of the routing key the queue is binded to.

> Make sure to start the consumer application to start consuming the messages.

```typescript
import { ConsumeMessage } from 'amqplib';
import { Consume, Consumer } from 'rabbitmq';

export class ActivityLogConsumer extends Consumer {
    @Consume('CMS_EXCHANGE', 'activity_log')
    async onActivityLog(message: ConsumeMessage) {
        const activityLogPayload = JSON.parse(message.content.toString());
        console.log(
            'Payload consumed on activity_log queue',
            activityLogPayload
        );
    }
}
```

Above example registers the `onActivityLog` method as the message handler for all the messages that lands on the `activity_log` queue in the 'CMS_EXCHANGE' exchange.
