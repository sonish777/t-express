# Controllers and Route Handlers

## Controllers

Controllers are classes that has methods for handling requests for the current resource. Controllers are created with the help of decoratos.

### Creating controllers

To create a controller, create a class and decorate it with either `Controller()` or `ApiController()` decorator imported from `core` packages. Both the decorators take a base url as the first argument.

```javascript
@Controller('/auth')
class AuthController {}

@ApiController('/api-auth')
class ApiAuthController {}
```

### Fallback controllers

The `Controller()` decorator also takes an optional second argument `options` for marking the controller as a fallback controller. Fallback controllers are used to handle unknown requests (or routes that are not registered).

```javascript

@Controller('*', { fallback: true }) {
    @Route({ path: '', method: HTTPMethods.All })
    handleFallback(_req: Request, _res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
        return next(new HttpException(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, 'Unknown Route Not found'));
    }
}

```

> In above example, the `'*'` is used so that the handler will catch any routes, and the `HttpMethods.ALL ('all')` is used to identify that the handler should catch any kinds of HTTP methods.

## Route Handlers

Similar to controllers, route handlers are also registered with the help of decorators. The `Route()` decorator is used to mark a method as a route handler. The route method requires a configuration argument to be provided. The configurations include:

-   path: The route url.
-   method: The HTTP method.
-   middlewares: An optional array of the middlewares to be applied to the route;
-   validators: An optional array of validators to be applied to the route. This is used for POST HTTP requests for validating the request payload. For creating these validators, take the `Validators` reference;

> Note: The controller base path and the route path together are used to define the route parameters.

```javascript
@Controller('/users')
class UserController {
    @Route({ path: '/find', method: HttpMethods.GET })
    find(req: Request, res: Response) {
        // implementation
    }
}
```

In above example, a GET HTTP route is registered for path `/users/find`. The route handler `find()` follows the same method definition as the Express.Handlers.
